//! The client contract of the hotpath.rs API: the types and rules a client
//! branches on, shared by the `hotpath-cloud` upload client
//! (`lib_on/cloud.rs`), the `hotpath cloud` CLI (`cloud` binary feature) and
//! the hotpath-backend server, which depends on this crate with the `json`
//! feature and serializes these types, so the compiler ties what the server
//! sends to what the clients read.
//!
//! Every body a client only prints (auth status, repository and benchmark
//! lists, reports, diffs) is owned by hotpath-backend, which may add to it or
//! reshape it without a hotpath release: the CLI passes it through as
//! received. A field moves into this contract only when a client starts
//! reading it.
//!
//! Deliberately minimal: the server owns every sentence, the clients print it
//! and branch only on `ApiError::code` and the fields below.
