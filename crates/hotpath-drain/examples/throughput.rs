//! Sample use of hotpath-drain: several producer threads push one million
//! events in total into a shared registry while a single consumer thread
//! sweeps the queues, then drains what is left at shutdown.
//!
//! Producers and consumer run in lockstep rounds, so sweep counts and
//! allocations are fixed by the constants below rather than by scheduling.
//! Changing the constants breaks comparability with previously uploaded reports.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   cargo run -p hotpath-drain --example throughput --release
//!   cargo run -p hotpath-drain --example throughput --release --features hotpath-meta
//!   cargo run -p hotpath-drain --example throughput --release --features hotpath-meta,hotpath-alloc-meta
