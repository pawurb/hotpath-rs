- route: METHOD template key
- count: number of requests served
- status_4xx / status_5xx: responses with a 4xx / 5xx status
- sql_per_request / http_per_request: average SQL queries and outbound HTTP requests issued per request (absent when not measurable)
- avg, total, and percentiles: formatted durations (measured until the response head is produced; body streaming is excluded)
- percent_total: share of total server time
- alloc: with hotpath-alloc-meta, bytes_per_request, allocs_per_request, total_bytes, and formatted avg/total/percentiles/percent_total of memory allocated per request
