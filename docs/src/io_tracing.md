# Monitor File, Socket and Async I/O Streams in Rust

`hotpath` instruments byte-level I/O to surface slow reads and writes - files, sockets, TLS streams, TCP connections like Redis, compression streams, and any custom I/O type. For every wrapped value it tracks, per operation kind (read, write, flush, shutdown):

- **Operation count** - completed operations
- **Bytes processed** - total bytes read or written
- **Rate** - per-operation transfer speed: bytes divided by summed in-flight operation time, waiting included
- **Duration** - average and configured percentiles. Synchronous operations measure the full method call; async operations measure from the first poll to `Ready`, so reported durations include async waiting time (e.g. waiting for a socket to become readable), not only the final poll execution.
- **Errors** - failed operations. Retryable conditions (`WouldBlock`, `Interrupted`) are not counted as errors and produce no operation.

The `io!` macro is noop unless the `hotpath` feature is activated.

## io! macro

Wrap any value implementing `std::io::Read`, `std::io::Write`, `tokio::io::AsyncRead`, or `tokio::io::AsyncWrite` (async traits require the `tokio` feature). The wrapper delegates every operation to the wrapped value, so it is a drop-in replacement.

Profiling file read operation:
```rust
use std::io::Read;

let mut file = hotpath::io!(std::fs::File::open("data.bin")?, label = "data-file");
let mut buf = Vec::new();
file.read_to_end(&mut buf)?;
```

See the [basic_io_sync](https://github.com/pawurb/hotpath-rs/blob/main/crates/test-io/examples/basic_io_sync.rs) and [basic_io_async](https://github.com/pawurb/hotpath-rs/blob/main/crates/test-io/examples/basic_io_async.rs) examples.

Async I/O works the same way.

Profiling Redis TCP connection:
```rust
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

let stream = tokio::net::TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:6379").await?;
let mut stream = hotpath::io!(stream, label = "redis");
stream.write_all(b"PING\r\n").await?;

let mut buf = [0u8; 7];
stream.read_exact(&mut buf).await?; // +PONG\r\n
```

See the [basic_redis_io](https://github.com/pawurb/hotpath-rs/blob/main/crates/test-io/examples/basic_redis_io.rs) example.

The `label` parameter is optional; without it the wrapper is identified by `file:line`.

The wrapper derefs to the wrapped value, so its `&self`/`&mut self` methods are callable directly. For consuming methods (e.g. a codec's `finish(self)`), unwrap first with `hotpath::io_unwrap`:

```rust
use std::io::Write;

let mut encoder = hotpath::io!(
    flate2::write::GzEncoder::new(Vec::new(), flate2::Compression::default()),
    label = "gzip"
);
encoder.write_all(data)?;
let compressed = hotpath::io_unwrap(encoder).finish()?;
```

With profiling disabled `io!` returns its argument unchanged and `io_unwrap` is the identity, so call sites compile identically in both modes.

See the [basic_zstd_io](https://github.com/pawurb/hotpath-rs/blob/main/crates/test-io/examples/basic_zstd_io.rs) example, which unwraps a zstd encoder with `io_unwrap` before `finish()`.

Report entries are keyed by creation site and concrete type: wrappers created repeatedly at one `io!` call - for example per accepted connection in a server loop - accumulate into a single entry, so profiler memory stays bounded by the number of `io!` call sites rather than the number of values ever wrapped.

## What you measure depends on what you wrap

Wrapping the underlying resource (a `File`, `TcpStream`, or TLS stream) measures actual resource I/O: every syscall-level read and write, with buffering layers above it invisible.

Wrapping a `BufReader` or `BufWriter` instead measures application-facing buffered operations: many small reads served from the buffer, with the occasional large refill hidden inside them.

```rust
// Measures actual file I/O (large, infrequent reads).
let file = hotpath::io!(std::fs::File::open("data.bin")?, label = "file-raw");
let mut reader = std::io::BufReader::new(file);

// Measures application-facing reads (small, frequent, mostly buffer hits).
let mut reader = hotpath::io!(
    std::io::BufReader::new(std::fs::File::open("data.bin")?),
    label = "file-buffered"
);
```

## Compression encoders

Write-side encoders (`flate2::write::GzEncoder`, `brotli::CompressorWriter`, `zstd::stream::write::Encoder`) do their compression work inside the `write` calls they receive, so wrapping the encoder measures compression throughput directly: the write row's Bytes is the uncompressed input and Rate is how fast the codec consumes it. Two usage details keep those numbers honest.

**Flush before unwrapping.** A consuming finalizer (`finish(self)`, `into_inner(self)`) runs after `io_unwrap` has removed the wrapper, so whatever work it performs is invisible to the profiler. Call `flush()` on the wrapper first: the encoder compresses and emits its buffered tail inside an instrumented flush operation, leaving only the stream epilogue to the finalizer. The tail is usually small - for brotli at quality 9 compressing 8 MB, the writes take ~680 ms while flush plus `into_inner` take ~1 ms - but the flush keeps the accounting complete regardless of how much the codec had buffered:

```rust
use std::io::Write;

let mut encoder = hotpath::io!(
    brotli::CompressorWriter::new(Vec::new(), 4096, 9, 22),
    label = "brotli"
);
encoder.write_all(data)?;
encoder.flush()?; // compress the buffered tail while still instrumented
let compressed = hotpath::io_unwrap(encoder).into_inner();
```

**Wrap both sides to see the compression ratio.** The encoder wrapper only counts uncompressed input bytes. Nest a second `io!` around the encoder's sink and the report pairs two rows: input bytes at compression speed, and output bytes (at memcpy speed - that row's Rate is not meaningful, its Bytes column is the point):

```rust
let mut encoder = hotpath::io!(
    flate2::write::GzEncoder::new(
        hotpath::io!(Vec::new(), label = "gzip-out"),
        flate2::Compression::new(9),
    ),
    label = "gzip"
);
```

The `gzip` row then reports e.g. 8.0 MB consumed at 19 MB/s while `gzip-out` reports the 1.0 MB that came out the other side. See the [compression_levels_io](https://github.com/pawurb/hotpath-rs/blob/main/crates/test-io/examples/compression_levels_io.rs) example, which compares gzip and brotli across five compression levels this way.

Read-side encoders (`flate2::read::GzEncoder`, `brotli::CompressorReader`) invert the accounting: reads return compressed bytes, so the wrapper's Bytes is the compressed output, and stream finalization happens inside the last instrumented reads. Wrap whichever side produces the number you want to read off the report.

## Cancellation caveat

Async operation durations span from the first poll to `Ready`. If an operation's future is cancelled mid-`Pending` (e.g. a `tokio::select!` timeout drops a `read()` future), the wrapper cannot observe the cancellation; the next operation in the same direction resumes the pending span and reports the time since the abandoned operation began.

## Report

The terminal report renders reads and writes as stacked sub-tables (a sub-table is skipped if there were no operations of that kind). The write sub-table carries the flush count, and its Errors column aggregates write, flush, and shutdown errors so failures surfaced during flush aren't hidden; per-kind error counts appear in the JSON report, where shutdown operations are also broken out. Metrics are also exposed at `GET /io` and in the TUI on the I/O tab, Bytes sub-tab.

Entries are keyed by creation site: all wrapper instances created at one `io!` call (e.g. per accepted connection in a server) accumulate into a single row, and the `Inst` column shows how many instances that row aggregates. Pass `iter = true` to give every instance its own row instead (displayed as `label`, `label-2`, `label-3`, ...) with individual rates and byte counts - profiler state then grows with the number of instances ever created, so prefer the default aggregation for call sites with unbounded instance churn.

`Rate` is per-operation transfer speed - bytes divided by summed in-flight operation time (waiting included, so on request/response traffic it reads as application-observed speed rather than wire speed). For a row aggregating concurrent instances the rate stays duration-weighted per operation, not the call site's aggregate bandwidth; `Rate * Inst` bounds the aggregate from above when all instances operate concurrently. Under time sampling the rate is computed from timed operations only, and shows `-` in count-only mode.

`Seek`, `AsyncSeek`, `BufRead`, and `AsyncBufRead` delegation is not yet instrumented.
