# Performance budgets: absolute limits for Rust functions, queries and routes

> **Note:** hotpath Cloud is currently in closed beta.

A performance budget is a hard limit on one function, query, route or other profiled entry: `"this function never allocates more than 1 KB per call"`, `"this query runs at most once per request"`. The [regression policy](regression_policy.md) compares a pull request with its baseline, so slow drift over many pull requests passes it. A budget is checked on every report on its own, so it holds whatever the baseline did, and it works on the first pull request and on pushes to the default branch.

Budgets live in the same file as the [regression policy](regression_policy.md) rules, `hotpath/policy.toml`. A broken budget fails the verdict like a regression.

## Functions

Allocations, timing and call count of [instrumented functions](functions.md).

```toml
[[functions.budgets]]
match = "my_crate::parser::parse"
alloc = { avg = "1 KB", total = "10 MB" }
timing = { avg = "250 us", p95 = "1 ms" }
calls = { min = 1000, max = 1000 }
message = "parse must stay allocation-light"
```

`alloc` takes bytes and `timing` durations, for `avg`, `total` and percentiles. `match` is the function name.

## SQL queries

Timing and execution count of [SQL queries](sql_tracing.md).

```toml
[[sql.budgets]]
match = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?*"
timing = { avg = "2 ms", total = "50 ms" }
count = { max = 100 }
```

`match` runs against `query | route | source`, so a pattern on the query alone, ending with `*`, matches it wherever it ran.

## HTTP requests

Timing, errors and request count of [outbound HTTP requests](http_tracing.md).

```toml
[[http.budgets]]
match = "*api.stripe.com*"
timing = { avg = "300 ms", errors = 0 }
count = { max = 20 }
```

`match` runs against `endpoint | route | source`.

## Server routes

Allocations, response time and downstream calls of each [served route](axum_tracing.md).

```toml
[[server.budgets]]
match = "GET /users/{id}"
alloc = { bytes_per_request = 65536, allocs_per_request = 200 }
timing = { p95 = "50 ms", status_5xx = 0, sql_per_request = 1 }
```

`timing` takes `avg`, `total` and percentiles as durations, `status_4xx` and `status_5xx` as counts, `sql_per_request` and `http_per_request` as numbers. `alloc` takes `avg`, `total` and percentiles as bytes, `bytes_per_request` and `allocs_per_request` as numbers. `match` is the route as `METHOD template`.

## Mutexes

Wait and hold time of [mutexes](locks.md).

```toml
[[mutexes.budgets]]
match = "app_state"
timing = { wait_avg = "100 us", acquire_avg = "1 ms" }
```

`match` is the lock's label.

## RwLocks

Wait and hold time of [read-write locks](locks.md), for reads and writes.

```toml
[[rw_locks.budgets]]
match = "config_cache"
timing = { read_wait_avg = "50 us", write_acquire_avg = "1 ms" }
```

`match` is the lock's label. `count` is reads and writes together.

## Channels

Delay, backlog and throughput of [channels](data_flow.md).

```toml
[[channels.budgets]]
match = "events"
flow = { delay_avg = "1 ms", max_queue_size = 1000, received_per_sec = 5000 }
sent_count = { min = 10000 }
```

`sent_per_sec` and `received_per_sec` are **minimums**: the channel must move at least that many messages per second. The rest are maximums. The count is `sent_count`.

## I/O

Latency, throughput and errors of [I/O streams](io_tracing.md).

```toml
[[io.budgets]]
match = "upload_socket*"
flow = { avg = "5 ms", errors = 0, bytes_per_sec = "10 MB" }
```

`bytes_per_sec` is a **minimum**, the rest are maximums. `match` runs against `label | operation | -`, so a pattern on the label alone matches every operation on it.

## Options

Every rule takes:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `match` | The entry the rule applies to. `*` matches any run of characters, and the pattern must match the whole name. Every entry it matches is checked on its own. |
| `calls` / `count` / `sent_count` | `{ min, max }` on how many times the entry ran: `calls` for functions, `sent_count` for channels, `count` for the rest. |
| `alloc`, `timing`, `flow` | Limits on the resource's metrics, as in the sections above. |
| `message` | Optional text shown next to a broken rule in the comment, up to 256 bytes. |

Values carry their unit:

| Kind | Written as |
|---|---|
| durations | `"250 ns"`, `"250 us"`, `"5 ms"`, `"1.5 s"` |
| bytes | `"512 B"`, `"1 KB"`, `"10 MB"` (1 KB = 1024 B) |
| bytes per second | `"10 MB"`, `"500 B"` |
| counts | a whole number: `0`, `1000` |
| per-request numbers | a number: `1`, `2.5` |

A percentile name with a dot is quoted: `timing = { "p99.9" = "5 ms" }`.

**Every rule checks that its entry ran.** Without a `min`, the count must be at least 1, so a `match` with a typo or a renamed function breaks the budget instead of passing silently. Write `calls = { min = 0 }` for an entry that may not run.

`ignore`, `judged`, `min_percent_change`, `min_calls` and `min_percent_total` do not apply to budgets: a rule names its entry explicitly. A resource takes up to 64 rules.

## Broken budgets

A broken budget is listed under "Budgets" in the pull request comment, with the value, the limit and the rule's `message`, and the heading counts it:

```
⛔ my_crate::parser::parse: alloc.avg 1.4 KB, over budget 1.0 KB: parse must stay allocation-light
⛔ my_crate::flush: not called
```
