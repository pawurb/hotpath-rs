# Function performance profiling: timing and memory metrics

To start profiling functions performance you'll only need `#[hotpath::main]` and `#[hotpath::measure]` macros:

```rust
#[hotpath::measure]
fn sync_function(sleep: u64) {
    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_nanos(sleep));
}

#[hotpath::measure]
async fn async_function(sleep: u64) {
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_nanos(sleep)).await;
}

// When using with tokio, place the #[tokio::main] first
#[tokio::main]
#[hotpath::main]
async fn main() {
    for i in 0..100 {
        // Measured functions will automatically send metrics
        sync_function(i);
        async_function(i * 2).await;

        // Measure code blocks with static labels
        hotpath::measure_block!("custom_block", {
            std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_nanos(i * 3))
        });
    }
}
```

When the `hotpath` feature is disabled, all macros are noop and have zero compile or runtime overhead.

Run your program with a hotpath feature:

```bash
cargo run --features=hotpath
```

Output:

## `#[hotpath::main]` macro

Attribute macro that initializes the background measurement processing when applied. Supports parameters:

- `percentiles = [50, 95, 99]` - Custom percentiles to display, sorted and deduplicated, at most 10 (defaults to `[95]`)
- `format = "json"` - Output format `"table"`, `"json"`, `"json-pretty"`, `"none"` (defaults to `table`)
- `limit = 20` - Maximum number of functions to display (default: `15`, `0` = show all)
- `output_path = "report.json"` - Filesystem path for profiling reports. If not set, the report is written to `stdout`. Can be overridden by `HOTPATH_OUTPUT_PATH`; on Unix, set that env var to `/dev/stdout` or `/dev/stderr` to redirect to the standard streams.
- `report = "functions-timing,channels"` - Report sections spec: `all`, `auto`, an exact comma-separated list of section names, or auto with exclusions like `"auto,-threads"`. Defaults to auto - function and thread sections plus every instrumented section with data (overridden by `HOTPATH_REPORT` env var)

## `#[hotpath::measure]` macro

An attribute macro that instruments functions to send timing/memory measurements to the background processor. Parameters:

- `log = true` - logs the result value when the function returns (requires `std::fmt::Debug` on return type)
- `label = "name"` - replaces the full reported identifier (instead of `module_path::<fn_name>`).
- `impl_type = "Type"` - inserts the enclosing type segment so the registered name becomes `module_path::<Type>::<fn_name>`. Use this for bare `#[hotpath::measure]` on a method inside an `impl` not covered by `measure_all`. Required for correct CPU sampling attribution under `hotpath-cpu` (see [CPU profiling](./cpu_profiling.md)), since the demangled symbol contains the type segment.
- `future = true` - additionally tracks the async function as a future: poll counts, poll durations, and pending/ready/cancelled state transitions. Only valid on `async fn`.

Example:

```rust
#[hotpath::measure(log = true)]
fn compute() -> i32 {
    // The result value will be logged in TUI console
    42
}

#[hotpath::measure(label = "db_query")]
fn fetch_user(id: u64) { /* ... */ }

struct Worker;
impl Worker {
    #[hotpath::measure(impl_type = "Worker")]
    fn run(&self) { /* ... */ }
}
```

### Async functions and `future = true`

`#[hotpath::measure]` on an `async fn` records its wall-clock time and allocations in the functions report, but nothing about how the future itself behaves. Add `future = true` to also register it in the [futures section](./data_flow.md#futures-monitoring), which shows poll counts, average poll duration, and whether calls completed or were cancelled:

```rust
#[hotpath::measure(future = true)]
async fn fetch_data() -> Vec<u8> {
    // Reported under both functions and futures, keyed by the function path
    vec![1, 2, 3]
}
```

This is the recommended way to monitor async functions: one attribute covers timing, allocations and future lifecycle. The `future!` and `#[future_fn]` macros from the [async data flow](./data_flow.md#futures-monitoring) page are for ad-hoc future expressions.

## `#[hotpath::measure_all]` macro

An attribute macro that applies `#[measure]` to all functions in a `mod` or `impl` block. Useful for bulk instrumentation without annotating each function individually. Can be used on:

- **Inline module declarations** - Instruments all functions within the module
- **Impl blocks** - Instruments all methods in the implementation

Example:

```rust
// Measure all methods in an impl block
#[hotpath::measure_all]
impl Calculator {
    fn add(&self, a: u64, b: u64) -> u64 { a + b }
    fn multiply(&self, a: u64, b: u64) -> u64 { a * b }
    async fn async_compute(&self) -> u64 { /* ... */ }
}

// Measure all functions in a module
#[hotpath::measure_all]
mod math_operations {
    pub fn complex_calculation(x: f64) -> f64 { /* ... */ }
    pub async fn fetch_data() -> Vec<u8> { /* ... */ }
}
```

> **Note:** Once Rust stabilizes [`#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene)]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/language-features/proc-macro-hygiene.html?highlight=proc_macro_hygiene#proc_macro_hygiene) and [`#![feature(custom_inner_attributes)]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/language-features/custom-inner-attributes.html), it will be possible to use `#![measure_all]` as an inner attribute directly inside module files (e.g., at the top of `math_operations.rs`) to automatically instrument all functions in that module.

> **Note (CPU sampling):** On inherent impl blocks (`impl Type { ... }`), `measure_all` auto-injects the type segment so methods are registered as `module_path::<Type>::<method>` - this matches the demangled symbol used by `hotpath-cpu` attribution. Trait impls (`impl Trait for Type`) are still instrumented for timing/allocation, but their demangled symbols use the `<Type as Trait>::method` form, so CPU sampling will not attribute samples to those methods.

## `#[hotpath::skip]` macro

A marker attribute that excludes specific functions from instrumentation when used within a module or impl block annotated with `#[measure_all]`. The function executes normally but doesn't send measurements to the profiling system.

Example:

```rust
#[hotpath::measure_all]
mod operations {
    pub fn important_function() { /* ... */ } // Measured

    #[hotpath::skip]
    pub fn not_so_important_function() { /* ... */ } // NOT measured
}
```

## `hotpath::measure_block!` macro

Macro that measures the execution time of a code block with a static string label.

```rust
#[hotpath::main]
fn main() {
    for i in 0..100 {
        // Measure code blocks with static labels
        hotpath::measure_block!("custom_block", {
            std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_nanos(i * 3))
        });
    }
}
```

If `hotpath` feature is disabled, the code inside block will still execute.

## Memory and allocations profiling

In addition to time-based profiling, `hotpath` can track memory allocations. This feature uses a custom global allocator from [allocation-counter crate](https://github.com/fornwall/allocation-counter) to intercept all memory allocations and provides detailed statistics about memory usage per function.

Run your program with the allocation tracking feature to print a similar report:

```
cargo run --features='hotpath,hotpath-alloc'
```

<img loading="lazy" src="{{#asset-hash images/hotpath-alloc-report.png}}" alt="hotpath-rs memory allocation profiling report showing per-function byte counts">

## Memory profiling modes

By default, allocation tracking is **exclusive**, meaning each function only reports allocations made directly at its own level, excluding nested instrumented calls.

To switch to **cumulative** mode (where a function's allocation count includes all allocations from nested instrumented calls), set `HOTPATH_ALLOC_CUMULATIVE=true`. Note that cumulative mode produces invalid results for recursive functions because the same allocations are counted multiple times as they propagate up through each recursive frame.

## Custom inner allocator

The tracking allocator forwards every allocation to an inner allocator, `std::alloc::System` by default. To profile a program that uses a different allocator, pass it via the `allocator` parameter of `#[hotpath::main]`. For example, with [tikv-jemallocator](https://github.com/tikv/jemallocator):

```toml
[dependencies]
tikv-jemallocator = "0.6"
```

```rust
#[hotpath::measure]
fn alloc_work() {
    let buf = vec![0u8; 4096];
    std::hint::black_box(&buf);
}

#[hotpath::main(allocator = tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc)]
fn main() {
    for _ in 0..100 {
        alloc_work();
    }
}
```

```bash
cargo run --features='hotpath,hotpath-alloc'
```

The report now shows per-function allocation stats measured through jemalloc: every allocation is counted by the tracking wrapper, then served by jemalloc instead of the system allocator.

The path must name a unit struct implementing `GlobalAlloc` (like `MiMalloc` from [mimalloc](https://github.com/purpleprotocol/mimalloc_rust) or `Jemalloc` from [tikv-jemallocator](https://github.com/tikv/jemallocator)). When the `hotpath-alloc` feature is disabled, the parameter is ignored and no allocator is installed, so combine it with your own `#[global_allocator]` behind a feature gate if the program should also use the allocator in normal builds.

All four `GlobalAlloc` methods (`alloc`, `dealloc`, `alloc_zeroed`, `realloc`) forward to the inner allocator's native implementations, so wrapping does not change its zeroed-allocation or reallocation behavior. A successful `realloc` is tracked as a deallocation of the old size plus an allocation of the new size.

## Allocation tracking with `HotpathGuardBuilder`

The `#[hotpath::main]` macro installs the tracking allocator for you. The [`HotpathGuardBuilder`](https://docs.rs/hotpath/latest/hotpath/struct.HotpathGuardBuilder.html) API does not do that (a `#[global_allocator]` must be declared as a static item), so when initializing hotpath programmatically you must declare it yourself:

```rust
#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: hotpath::CountingAllocator = hotpath::CountingAllocator::new();

fn main() {
    let _hotpath = hotpath::HotpathGuardBuilder::new("main").build();
    // ...
}
```

Use `hotpath::CountingAllocator::with(...)` to wrap a custom inner allocator:

```rust
#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: hotpath::CountingAllocator<tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc> =
    hotpath::CountingAllocator::with(tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc);
```

The declaration needs no feature gating: `CountingAllocator` is exported in every feature configuration, and when `hotpath-alloc` (or `hotpath` itself) is disabled it is a pure pass-through to the inner allocator with no tracking overhead. This also makes it the simplest way to keep a custom allocator active in normal builds: the program always runs on jemalloc, and allocation tracking switches on only with `hotpath-alloc`.

Don't combine a manual declaration with `#[hotpath::main]` - under `hotpath-alloc` the macro installs its own `#[global_allocator]`, and two declarations fail to compile. Use the `allocator` parameter with the macro, and the manual declaration with the builder.
