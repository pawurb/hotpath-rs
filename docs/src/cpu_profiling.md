# Rust CPU Profiling with samply

`hotpath` provides sampling-based CPU profiling for Rust using [samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply). Unlike pure CPU sampling, hotpath instrumentation shows how your program spends time, letting you tell apart CPU-bound, I/O-bound, and memory-bound bottlenecks. This guide covers installing samply, configuring permissions on macOS and Linux, and reading the CPU usage report.

By comparing the CPU report against the timing and allocation reports, you can pin down what kind of bottleneck you have: high wall-clock time but low CPU samples means I/O-bound (waiting), high CPU samples means CPU-bound (computing), and high allocation counts point to memory pressure. See [Sampling comparison](/blog/sampling_comparison) for a detailed explanation of how the profiling modes differ.

CPU profiling requires some additional system configuration, covered below.

## Configuring samply CPU profiler

Start by installing `samply`:

```bash
cargo install samply --locked
```

and verify version:

```bash
samply --version
```

`hotpath` is tested to work with version `0.13.x`.

Then install the `hotpath-samply` wrapper binary that ships with `hotpath`:

```bash
cargo install hotpath --bin hotpath-samply --version '^{{HOTPATH_VERSION}}'
```

Both `samply` and `hotpath-samply` must be available in your `PATH` at runtime. The host process spawns `hotpath-samply` as a child, which in turn invokes `samply` to record the profile.

If either binary lives outside `PATH`, point `hotpath` at it explicitly:

- `HOTPATH_SAMPLY_WRAPPER_BIN` - path to the `hotpath-samply` wrapper binary the host process spawns (default: `hotpath-samply`, resolved via `PATH`).
- `HOTPATH_SAMPLY_BIN` - path to the external `samply` binary the wrapper invokes (default: `samply`, resolved via `PATH`).

### macOS: granting samply profiling permissions

Run:

```bash
samply setup
```

It will prompt you to sign `samply` binary so that it can attach to a running process by its PID. 

### Linux: enabling kernel profiling for samply

On Linux, CPU profiling requires elevated kernel profiling permissions. Run:

```bash
echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
```

These settings allow `samply` to attach to a running process and collect kernel-level profiling information.

The configuration is temporary and resets after reboot. Consider persisting it via `/etc/sysctl.d/`.

Another caveat when using `samply` with `hotpath` on Linux is that you must prefix the profiled command with `setsid -w`. So instead of:

```bash
cargo run --features='hotpath,hotpath-alloc,hotpath-cpu'
```

you should run:

```bash
setsid -w cargo run --features='hotpath,hotpath-alloc,hotpath-cpu'
```

Otherwise the parent process may exit before `hotpath` finishes the profiling report.

## Using a Rust CPU profiler with hotpath

You must build with debug symbols enabled in order to attribute CPU samples to instrumented functions. Symbols are included by default in debug profile builds. `--release` builds don't include this info, so you should use a dedicated profile instead:

`Cargo.toml`
```toml
[profile.profiling]
inherits = "release"
debug = true
```

Now run your example with an additional `hotpath-cpu` flag: 

```bash
cargo run --features='hotpath,hotpath-alloc,hotpath-cpu' --profile profiling
```

it will output a CPU usage report (in addition to wall-clock time and allocations):

```
+------------------------+---------+---------+
| Function               | Samples | % Total |
+------------------------+---------+---------+
| cpu_basic::sync_work   | 1915914 | 56.13%  |
+------------------------+---------+---------+
| cpu_basic::async_sleep | 14056   | 0.41%   |
+------------------------+---------+---------+
| cpu_basic::sync_alloc  | 1581    | 0.05%   |
+------------------------+---------+---------+
samply load /tmp/hotpath/61089-1778083683167502000/hp.json.gz
```

You can optionally run the displayed `samply load` command to open an interactive performance report:

## Exclusive vs inclusive attribution

By default attribution is exclusive: each CPU sample is credited to the innermost instrumented function on its stack, so a function's share excludes the instrumented functions it calls. Set `HOTPATH_CPU_INCLUSIVE=1` to credit a sample to every instrumented function on its stack instead; a function's share then includes its instrumented callees, and the shares no longer add up to 100%.

## Why inlined functions hide from CPU profilers

Standard CPU profilers sometimes miss top bottleneck functions because the compiler implicitly inlines small or hot functions. Once a function is inlined, its symbol disappears from the binary and its samples get attributed to the caller, hiding it from the report.

Under the `hotpath-cpu` feature, `#[hotpath::measure]` strip any user-provided `#[inline(...)]` attribute and inject `#[inline(never)]` instead. This forces the function to retain its own symbol so CPU samples attribute correctly.

To disable this rewrite, set `HOTPATH_KEEP_INLINE=1`. The variable is read at proc-macro expansion time, so touch the source file or run `cargo clean` after toggling it.

## Improving symbol attribution for impl methods

Currently `hotpath` correctly attributes CPU usage to module functions instrumented with `measure` macro. `impl` functions instrumented with `measure` require an additional config. 

```rust
impl Worker {
    #[hotpath::measure]
    fn run() {
      // ...
    }
}
```

The above example wouldn't correctly attribute CPU samples to the `run` function, because it's defined in an `impl` block. You have to explicitly declare `impl_type` to fix it:

```rust
impl Worker {
    #[hotpath::measure(impl_type = "Worker")]
    fn run() {
      // ...
    }
}
```

Alternatively you can use `measure_all` macro for `impl` functions to correctly attribute all symbols without additional config:

```rust
#[hotpath::measure_all]
impl Worker {
    fn run() {
      // ...
    }
}
```


## Current status

CPU profiling support is still experimental, so bug reports and feedback are highly appreciated.
