# Rust async monitoring: Futures, Streams and Channels performance

`hotpath` lets you monitor Rust channels performance in real time - alongside streams and futures. Track channel throughput, queue depth, identify slow consumers, monitor futures resolution, and discover bottlenecks while your system is running. With minimal instrumentation, you can get a clear picture of how data moves through your app's async pipeline.

All monitoring macros (`channel!`, `stream!`, `future!` and `future_fn`) are noop unless `hotpath` feature is activated.

## Channels monitoring

`hotpath::channel!` macro wraps channel creation to automatically track performance metrics and data flow:

```rust
use tokio::sync::mpsc;

#[tokio::main]
#[hotpath::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create and instrument a channel in one step
    let (tx, mut rx) = hotpath::channel!(mpsc::channel::<String>(100));

    // Use the channel exactly as before
    tx.send("Hello".to_string()).await.unwrap();
    let msg = rx.recv().await.unwrap();
}
```

### Wrapped channel types

By default `channel!` does not return the endpoints you passed in - it returns *instrumented wrappers* around them. The macro expands to a different type than the original:

```rust
// before: a plain crossbeam receiver
let (tx, rx): (crossbeam_channel::Sender<i32>, crossbeam_channel::Receiver<i32>) =
    crossbeam_channel::unbounded();

// after: the macro returns hotpath wrappers, not crossbeam_channel::Sender/Receiver
let (tx, rx) = hotpath::channel!(crossbeam_channel::unbounded::<i32>());
```

At a `let` binding this is invisible - type inference picks up whatever the macro returns. It only matters when you need to *name* the type, for example a struct field or a function signature. There you cannot write `crossbeam_channel::Sender<T>`, because the value is a wrapper, not a `crossbeam_channel::Sender`. (If you would rather keep the original endpoint types, use the legacy [`proxy = true`](#legacy-proxy--true-mode), which is type-transparent.)

Use the `hotpath::wrap::` path instead. It mirrors the original module layout, so you prefix the original path with `hotpath::wrap::`:

```rust
// before
struct Pipeline {
    jobs_tx: crossbeam_channel::Sender<Job>,
    jobs_rx: crossbeam_channel::Receiver<Job>,
}

// after - prefix the type with hotpath::wrap::
struct Pipeline {
    jobs_tx: hotpath::wrap::crossbeam_channel::Sender<Job>,
    jobs_rx: hotpath::wrap::crossbeam_channel::Receiver<Job>,
}
```

The same prefix works for every wrap-capable library:

- `hotpath::wrap::std::sync::mpsc::{Sender, SyncSender, Receiver}`
- `hotpath::wrap::tokio::sync::mpsc::{Sender, Receiver, UnboundedSender, UnboundedReceiver}`
- `hotpath::wrap::crossbeam_channel::{Sender, Receiver}`
- `hotpath::wrap::flume::{Sender, Receiver}`
- `hotpath::wrap::async_channel::{Sender, Receiver}`

This is purely to keep the compiler police happy: the `hotpath::wrap::` types are noop unless the `hotpath` feature is enabled. With the feature off they are plain re-exports of the original endpoints (zero overhead, **identical behavior**); with the feature on they resolve to the instrumented wrappers. Either way the field type lines up with what the macro returns, so the same code compiles in both configurations.

### Optional config

```rust
// Custom label for easier identification in TUI
let (tx, rx) = hotpath::channel!(mpsc::channel::<String>(100), label = "worker_queue");

// Enable message logging (requires std::fmt::Debug trait on message type)
let (tx, rx) = hotpath::channel!(mpsc::channel::<String>(100), log = true);

// One entry per channel instance instead of per call site
let (tx, rx) = hotpath::channel!(mpsc::channel::<String>(100), iter = true);
```

Label channels to display them on top of the list. By passing `log = true` TUI will display messages that a channel received.

### Call-site aggregation and `iter = true`

By default all channels created at one `channel!` call site (with the same message type) accumulate into a **single entry**. Counts and the latency histogram are summed across instances, and the `Inst` column reports how many instances the entry aggregates, so profiler state stays bounded even when a call site creates a channel per handled request. The first registration's `label` and channel kind/capacity win, and the entry shows `closed` once every aggregated instance has closed.

Semantics of the aggregated columns:

- **Sent/s, Recv/s** - aggregate call-site throughput: total messages divided by elapsed time since the call site's first message. This is a lifetime average, so bursty call sites read lower than their in-burst throughput.
- **Queue / Max queue** - combined in-flight depth across live instances, and its peak. With a single instance both keep their exact per-channel meaning.
- **Logs** (`log = true`) - one log window per call site: messages from all instances interleave and message ids restart per instance.

Pass `iter = true` to get one entry per channel instance instead, displayed with suffixed labels (`label`, `label-2`, `label-3`, ...) - e.g. one row per spawned worker with its individual counts and rate. Profiler state then grows with the number of channels ever created, so prefer the default aggregation for call sites with unbounded instance churn.

### Capacity parameter requirement

Bounded `std::sync::mpsc` channels require an explicit `capacity`, and **the value must match the `sync_channel(N)` argument**:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;

// std bounded - capacity MUST equal the sync_channel argument
let (tx, rx) = hotpath::channel!(mpsc::sync_channel::<String>(100), capacity = 100);
```

Wrap mode rebuilds the inner channel from `capacity` (std exposes no way to read it back from the endpoints) and discards the channel you constructed. If the two disagree - e.g. `sync_channel(100)` with `capacity = 1` - the profiled build gets a different bound than the unprofiled one (where `channel!` returns your original channel untouched), which can change backpressure or even deadlock only when profiling is enabled. Keep the numbers equal.

Tokio, crossbeam, flume, and async-channel recover the bound from the endpoint, so they need no `capacity` argument. `futures_channel::mpsc` bounded channels (forwarder-only, see below) also require `capacity = N` because their API doesn't expose it after creation.

### Legacy `proxy = true` mode

Passing `proxy = true` selects the legacy proxy forwarder-based instrumentation mode. Instead of wrapping the endpoints, `hotpath` spawns a background task/thread that relays every message through a second internal channel and observes sent/received counts at that boundary:

```rust
// keep the raw endpoint types; instrument via a forwarder
let (tx, rx) = hotpath::channel!(mpsc::channel::<String>(100), proxy = true);

// required for the forwarder-only backends
let (tx, rx) = hotpath::channel!(futures_channel::mpsc::channel::<i32>(10), proxy = true, capacity = 10);
let (tx, rx) = hotpath::channel!(tokio::sync::oneshot::channel::<i32>(), proxy = true);
```

Its only advantage is that it returns the original endpoint types unchanged (see [Wrapped types](#wrapped-types)), and it is required for backends that have no wrap implementation - `futures_channel` (mpsc and oneshot) and `tokio::sync::oneshot`. Calling `channel!` on one of those without `proxy = true` is a compile error that tells you to add it.

The trade-offs are significant. It **cannot measure send-receive latency accurately**: events are stamped inside the forwarder, in the middle of the pipeline, so `proc_avg`/percentiles and exact queue depth are omitted. Relaying every message through an extra channel and task also costs more - for some channel libraries up to **6x higher overhead** than the default wrap mode. Sent/received counts are observed at the proxy boundary rather than at the final consumer, and `try_send` may behave slightly differently since the proxy adds one slot of extra capacity. Prefer the default wrap mode unless you need the original endpoint types.

## Streams monitoring

### stream! macro

This macro instruments async streams to track performance metrics and items yielded:

```rust
use futures::stream::{self, StreamExt};

#[tokio::main]
#[hotpath::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create and instrument a stream in one step
    let s = hotpath::stream!(stream::iter(1..=100));

    // Use it normally
    let items: Vec<_> = s.collect().await;
}
```

### Optional config

```rust
// Custom label
let s = hotpath::stream!(stream::iter(1..=100), label = "data_stream");

// Enable item logging (requires std::fmt::Debug trait on item type)
let s = hotpath::stream!(stream::iter(1..=100), log = true);

// One entry per stream instance instead of per call site
let s = hotpath::stream!(stream::iter(1..=100), iter = true);
```

Label streams to display them on top of the list. By passing `log = true` TUI will display values that a stream yielded.

Like channels, streams aggregate by call site by default: all streams created at one `stream!` call (with the same item type) share a single entry with summed `items_yielded` and an `Inst` instance count, and the entry shows `closed` once every instance has completed. Pass `iter = true` for one suffixed entry per instance - profiler state then grows with the number of streams ever created.

## Futures monitoring

### future! and future_fn macros

The `future!` macro and `#[future_fn]` attribute instrument any async function or piece of code or to track poll counts and future lifecycle:

```rust
#[tokio::main]
#[hotpath::main]
async fn main() {
    // Instrument a future expression
    let result = hotpath::future!(async { 42 }, log = true).await;

    instrumented_fetch().await;
}

// Or use the attribute on async functions
#[hotpath::future_fn(log = true)]
async fn instrumented_fetch() -> Vec<u8> {
    vec![1, 2, 3]
}
```

### Optional config

```rust
// Custom label for easier identification in TUI
let result = hotpath::future!(async { 42 }, label = "my_future").await;

// Enable output logging (requires std::fmt::Debug trait on output type)
let result = hotpath::future!(async { 42 }, log = true).await;
```

Label futures to display them on top of the list. By passing `log = true` TUI will display values that future resolved to:
