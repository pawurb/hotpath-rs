# Rust HTTP Client Performance Profiling for reqwest and ureq

`hotpath` profiles outgoing HTTP requests made with [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) or [ureq](https://crates.io/crates/ureq), helping you identify slow endpoints, frequent request patterns, and failing calls. Requests are grouped by normalized endpoint, so parameter-varied requests to the same route are reported together: 1,000 calls to `GET example.com/users/{id}` appear as a single entry with call count, error count, average latency, percentiles, and total execution time.

## Wrapping the reqwest client

Add `hotpath` with the feature matching your `reqwest` crate version to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
hotpath = { version = "{{HOTPATH_VERSION}}", features = ["reqwest-0-13"] } # or "reqwest-0-12"
```

Wrap the client once at creation with the `http!` macro - every request sent through it is then profiled, with no other code changes required:

```rust
let client = hotpath::http!(reqwest::Client::new());

// Normal reqwest usage from here on:
let resp = client.get("https://example.com/users/1").send().await?;
```

Under the hood the macro wraps the client with [reqwest-middleware](https://github.com/TrueLayer/reqwest-middleware)'s `ClientWithMiddleware` and attaches hotpath's timing middleware. The wrapped client mirrors the full reqwest API (`get`, `post`, `json`, `header`, ...), so existing request-building code compiles unchanged.

To store the client in a struct with a type that stays the same whether profiling is on or off, use the `hotpath::wrap` prefix:

```rust
struct App {
    client: hotpath::wrap::reqwest::Client,
}
```

With `hotpath` enabled the type is `ClientWithMiddleware`; disabled the alias is the raw `reqwest::Client`. 

### Labels

An optional `label` prefixes every endpoint key produced by the client:

```rust
let github = hotpath::http!(reqwest::Client::new(), label = "github");
// -> "github: GET api.github.com/repos/{id}"
```

### Existing reqwest-middleware stacks

If your app already uses `reqwest-middleware` (e.g. for retries), skip the macro and attach the `hotpath::ReqwestHttpMiddleware` middleware directly:

```rust
let client = reqwest_middleware::ClientBuilder::new(reqwest::Client::new())
    .with(hotpath::ReqwestHttpMiddleware::new())
    .with(RetryTransientMiddleware::new_with_policy(retry_policy))
    .build();
```

Stack order matters: placed *before* a retry middleware, hotpath times the total including retries; placed *after* it, each attempt is timed separately.

## Instrumenting a ureq agent

Enable the `ureq-3` feature (ureq 3.x):

```toml
[dependencies]
hotpath = { version = "{{HOTPATH_VERSION}}", features = ["ureq-3"] }
```

ureq registers middleware on the agent's config builder, so the `http!` macro takes the `ConfigBuilder` rather than a finished agent. It returns the same builder with hotpath's middleware appended - build the agent from it as usual:

```rust
let agent: ureq::Agent = hotpath::http!(ureq::Agent::config_builder())
    .build()
    .new_agent();

// Normal ureq usage from here on:
let resp = agent.get("https://example.com/users/1").call()?;
```

The type doesn't change across profiling modes: with `hotpath` disabled the macro returns the builder untouched, so no `hotpath::wrap` alias is needed. Labels work the same way as for reqwest (`hotpath::http!(ureq::Agent::config_builder(), label = "github")`).

To control where hotpath sits in an existing middleware chain, skip the macro and add `hotpath::UreqHttpMiddleware` yourself. The type compiles into a pass-through middleware when `hotpath` is disabled, so the line can stay in place unconditionally:

```rust
let agent: ureq::Agent = ureq::Agent::config_builder()
    .middleware(hotpath::UreqHttpMiddleware::new())
    .build()
    .new_agent();
```

ureq's default `http_status_as_error(true)` returns 4xx/5xx responses as `Err(ureq::Error::StatusCode(..))`; hotpath recovers the status from that error, so those requests are recorded with their status (and counted in `Errors`) rather than as transport failures.

## Normalizing endpoints

Requests are grouped by `METHOD host/path`. The query string, fragment, and credentials are dropped, and path segments that look like identifiers collapse into `{id}`:

- all-digit segments (`/users/123`)
- UUIDs (`/jobs/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`)
- hex strings of 16+ characters (`/blobs/deadbeefdeadbeef`)

So `GET /users/1?verbose=true` and `GET /users/42` merge into one `GET example.com/users/{id}` bucket. Raw URLs never reach the report - only the normalized shape does.

## Source function attribution

Each request is attributed to the innermost `#[hotpath::measure]`-instrumented function that issued it - the `Source` column in the report and TUI. `hotpath` maintains a per-thread stack of instrumented function names: sync functions push their name on entry and pop on return, and async functions push and pop around every `poll`, so tasks interleaved on one runtime thread never report a stale caller. The middleware captures the source when the request starts, before the first await, while it is still executing in the caller's frame.

Source is part of the grouping key: the same endpoint hit from two different instrumented functions appears as two separate rows, so you can tell which code path is responsible for which share of the HTTP traffic. For blocking ureq calls the whole request runs on the caller's thread, so attribution is simply the innermost instrumented function on the current call stack.

If no instrumented function is active when the request is sent - the request comes from uninstrumented code, or from a spawned task whose functions aren't instrumented - the `Source` column shows `-`. To get attribution, annotate the functions that send requests (or their callers) with `#[hotpath::measure]`.

In axum applications wrapped with [`hotpath::axum!`](axum_tracing.md#route-scoping-for-sql-and-http) outbound requests are additionally grouped by the server route that issued them, shown in a `Route` column.

## Error tracking

Each bucket has an `Errors` column counting transport errors (DNS failures, connection refused, timeouts) plus responses with status >= 400.


## Limiting and capping endpoint output

The number of endpoints shown is unlimited by default (`0`). Cap it with:

- Builder: `.http_limit(n)`
- Env var: `HOTPATH_HTTP_LIMIT`

## What is measured

The middleware times reqwest's `execute` future (or, for ureq, the blocking `next.handle(req)` call), which resolves at a specific protocol moment: when the response **status line and headers have been fully received**. The `Response` returned at that point holds an open handle onto the connection - body bytes flow only when your code later awaits `.json()`, `.text()`, `.bytes()`, or polls `.bytes_stream()` (reads `body_mut()` for ureq), and by then the measurement is already recorded.

Included in the measured window:

- DNS resolution, TCP connect, and TLS handshake - but only when no pooled connection is reused; requests over a warm connection pool skip these
- *Sending* the request, including uploading the full request body
- Redirect hops (reqwest's `execute` and ureq's agent both follow redirects internally, so each hop's full round trip counts, bucketed under the original pre-redirect URL)
- Server processing time, up to receipt of the response headers

Excluded:

- Downloading the response body, decompression, and JSON deserialization

Note the asymmetry: request-body *upload* is inside the window, response-body *download* is outside it.

In practice the metric behaves like **time-to-first-byte plus connection cost**. An endpoint that is slow because the server computes for 800ms before answering shows up accurately. An endpoint that answers headers in 20ms and then streams 50MB of JSON for 4 seconds shows up as 20ms. A body-read failure also won't appear in the `Errors` column - by then the request was already recorded with its response status. For SSE and long-poll endpoints that keep the body open indefinitely this is the behavior you want (the request would otherwise never "complete"); for large payload downloads it undercounts.

This boundary is inherent to the middleware interception point in both clients - the `Middleware` chain hands back the `Response` as soon as headers arrive, and body consumption belongs to the caller. It captures server latency reliably; it is not a measure of network throughput.

## Other limitations

Only requests sent through wrapped clients are visible; HTTP calls made inside third-party crates holding their own `reqwest::Client` or `ureq::Agent` are not captured. For reqwest only the async client is supported - `reqwest::blocking` is not supported by `hotpath::http!`. For ureq only the agent-based API is instrumented; the free functions (`ureq::get(..)` etc.) use ureq's global agent, which carries no middleware.
