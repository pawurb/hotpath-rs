# Lock contention monitoring: RwLocks and Mutexes

<img loading="lazy" src="{{#asset-hash images/locks-contention.png}}" alt="hotpath-rs rw_locks report showing read/write wait and acquire time statistics">

`hotpath` instruments synchronization primitives to surface lock contention - one of the common and hard-to-spot causes of latency in concurrent Rust. For every acquisition it tracks two durations:

- **Wait time** - how long a caller was blocked *before* the lock was granted. High wait time means contention: threads are queuing for the lock.
- **Acquire time** - how long the lock was *held*, from granted to released. Long hold times are what create the contention other threads wait on.

Both the `rw_lock!` and `mutex!` macros are noop unless the `hotpath` feature is activated.

## RwLocks

### rw_lock! macro

Wrap a `RwLock` at creation. Read and write acquisitions are tracked separately, so you can see whether contention comes from readers, writers, or both.

```rust
let lock = hotpath::rw_lock!(std::sync::RwLock::new(0u32));

*lock.write().unwrap() += 1;
let _ = *lock.read().unwrap();
```

Use the `label` parameter to give the lock a readable name in the report (otherwise it is identified by `file:line`):

```rust
let lock = hotpath::rw_lock!(std::sync::RwLock::new(0u32), label = "config");
```

### Supported RwLock libraries

`std::sync::RwLock` can be instrumented by default. Enable the matching feature flag for each third-party library.

#### [std](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)

Built-in, no feature flag required.

- [`std::sync::RwLock`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html)

#### [parking_lot](https://github.com/Amanieu/parking_lot)

Enable the `parking_lot` feature.

- [`parking_lot::RwLock`](https://docs.rs/parking_lot/latest/parking_lot/type.RwLock.html)

#### [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)

Enable the `tokio` feature.

- [`tokio::sync::RwLock`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.RwLock.html)

#### [async-lock](https://github.com/smol-rs/async-lock)

Enable the `async-lock` feature.

- [`async_lock::RwLock`](https://docs.rs/async-lock/latest/async_lock/struct.RwLock.html)

## Mutexes

### mutex! macro

Wrap a `Mutex` at creation. A mutex has a single lock kind, so there is no read/write split - each row reports one set of wait and acquire stats.

```rust
let lock = hotpath::mutex!(std::sync::Mutex::new(0u64), label = "counter");

*lock.lock().unwrap() += 1;
```

The `label` parameter is optional; without it the lock is identified by `file:line`.

### Supported Mutex libraries

`std::sync::Mutex` can be instrumented by default. Enable the matching feature flag for each third-party library.

#### [std](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)

Built-in, no feature flag required.

- [`std::sync::Mutex`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html)

#### [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)

Enable the `tokio` feature.

- [`tokio::sync::Mutex`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Mutex.html)

#### [async-lock](https://github.com/smol-rs/async-lock)

Enable the `async-lock` feature.

- [`async_lock::Mutex`](https://docs.rs/async-lock/latest/async_lock/struct.Mutex.html)

### Including locks in the report

Lock sections are opt-in. Add them via the `HOTPATH_REPORT` env var (comma-separated `rw_locks`, `mutexes`, or `all`), or programmatically through `HotpathGuardBuilder::sections`:

```rust
let _guard = hotpath::HotpathGuardBuilder::new("main")
    .sections(vec![hotpath::Section::RwLocks, hotpath::Section::Mutexes])
    .build();
```

### Limits

The number of locks shown per section is unlimited by default (`0`). Cap it with:

- Macro: `#[hotpath::main(rw_locks_limit = n, mutexes_limit = n)]`
- Builder: `.rw_locks_limit(n)` / `.mutexes_limit(n)`
- Env vars: `HOTPATH_RW_LOCKS_LIMIT` / `HOTPATH_MUTEXES_LIMIT`

## Wrapped types

`rw_lock!` and `mutex!` do not return the lock you passed in - they return an *instrumented wrapper* around it. The macro expands to a different type than the original:

```rust
// before: a plain std RwLock
let lock: std::sync::RwLock<u32> = std::sync::RwLock::new(0);

// after: the macro returns a hotpath wrapper, not std::sync::RwLock
let lock = hotpath::rw_lock!(std::sync::RwLock::new(0u32));
```

At a `let` binding this is invisible - type inference picks up whatever the macro returns. It only matters when you need to *name* the type, for example a struct field or a function signature. There you cannot write `std::sync::RwLock<T>`, because the value is a wrapper, not an `std::sync::RwLock`.

Use the `hotpath::wrap::` path instead. It mirrors the standard module layout, so you prefix the original path with `hotpath::wrap::`:

```rust
// before
struct App {
    counter: std::sync::RwLock<u32>,
    name: std::sync::Mutex<String>,
}

// after - prefix the type with hotpath::wrap::
struct App {
    counter: hotpath::wrap::std::sync::RwLock<u32>,
    name: hotpath::wrap::std::sync::Mutex<String>,
}

let app = App {
    counter: hotpath::rw_lock!(std::sync::RwLock::new(0u32)),
    name: hotpath::mutex!(std::sync::Mutex::new(String::new())),
};
```

This is purely to keep the compiler police happy: `hotpath::wrap::std::sync::RwLock` is still noop unless the `hotpath` feature is enabled. With the feature off it is a plain re-export of `std::sync::RwLock` (zero overhead, **identical behavior**); with the feature on it resolves to the instrumented wrapper. Either way the field type lines up with what the macro returns, so the same code compiles in both configurations.
